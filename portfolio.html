                    <h3>Task Info</h3>
                    <p>Making a responsive website was our first serious task. I had to present certain style of design (Deconstruction), create a page introducing myself and document the design of the webpage itself.</p>
                    <img src="images/illustration_1.png" alt="responsive" class="responsive">
                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p>Making the website was a big step for me, because it was the first time when I had to code using html and css. I gained a lot of knowledge and in a very short period of time. Even though I started with the basics, I ended up with using grid layout to variate content on different devices. On the other hand, I had some trouble fixing issues that didn't let me validate css and html documents.</p>

                    <h3>Task Info</h3>
                    <p>For this task our group had to make a prototype of our microsite and its two pages of content for mobile devices on Adobe XD.</p>
                    <img src="images/ill2.png" alt="responsive" class="responsive">
                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p> Creating a design in a group can be a tricky situation. It tooks us more time to agree what color scheme we want on our webpage than what content we want to include.</p><br>

                    <h3>Task Info</h3>
                    <p>This task required to tell a 1 - 1.5 minute story without words. I teamed up with Simon, Lili and Luiza to turn it into a final product. Our decision was to create a simple boy and girl situation.</p>
                    <img src="images/ill3.png" alt="responsive" class="responsive">
                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p>I understood how hard it is to find the perfect solution in a group in a very short time, because everyone had personal problems cutting time. I also learned how to write a plot for a video and act, since Simon took the part of shooting and editing.</p>

                    <h3>Task Info</h3>
                    <p>For these two task we were arranged to work in groups. We had to create a story for our microsite, which included a beginning, a middle and an end and we had to consider the dramaturgical model.</p>
                    <p>Before filming we needed to make a storyboard, that clarified for all group members what images and dramaturgical elements we needed in order to tell the story. The storyboard had to explain the close ups, medium shots and long shots.</p>
                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p>Doing these task I improved my listening skills and learned what does it mean to "kill your darlings", because some of my ideas were hard to make without professional skills. For the storyboard I wanted to try out filming some scenes myself, so we decided to go and try to make my ideas into reality.</p>

                    <h3>Task Info</h3>
                    <p>This part of the task was to make a document which included info about our group, technical documentation of images, treatment and storyboard of the video, moodboard and style tile for microsite, design principles applied and last but not least test results.</p>
                    <img src="images/ill4.png" alt="responsive" class="responsive">
                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p>The hardest part for me, while making such a big documentation for the first time, was remembering and documenting exactly what we did all two weeks of the project. I learned that it is crucial to document everything at the exact time during the process.</p>

                    <p>The last hand-in of the group project was to submit a website which was a final product of our team. The website had to be 2-3 pages, be responsive to small, medium and large screens, include images that are normal and retina, video that we shot and be validated.</p>
                    <img src="images/ill5.png" alt="responsive" class="responsive">
                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p> In this task I mostly did the video shooting, a bit of designing and coordinating work in group, since it was 5 of us with a lot of Ideas. In the end we were satisfied with our work, because we didn't encounter a lot of problems and managed to work as one unit.</p>

                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p> This was the first time for me using js. I learned how to use spritesheets and make moving characters with javascript functions that trigger keyframes. I wanted to learn as much as possible and make the animations webpage look as much as a normal webpage of a webgame.</p>

                    <p>For this task I was given a week to make my own story with protagonist and antagonist. Make my own graphics and animate one schene. For the hand-in I had to make a document that included: Storyboard, message of the story, genre/mood, narrative curve analysis, dramaturgic elements, style tile, charater design worksheet, backgrounds, spritesheet drawn in illustrator and link to animation.</p>
                    <img src="images/ill7.png" alt="responsive" class="responsive">

                    <h4>What I learned?</h4>
                    <p>By doing this I learned how to document my work from the start, create and design my own story, sketch scenes and characters using a pencil and paper and then redraw them in illustrator making my own spritesheet. I was introduced how narratives work and how to make analysis. In the end I ended up with a comical fictional story of an alien who got scared of the toilet.</p>

                    <p>In groups of 2 we had to think of a scene of an existing story or to come up with our own animation, make a storyboard and sequence diagram. I grouped up with Agnė and we decide to create our own story.</p>

                    <p>We splited the task; I code everything and Agnė makes illustrations. The hardest part was to code after Agnė finished drawing because I didn't make any code while she drew, I only made the Storyboard. So I had 2 hours to code everything, but most imporantly, I learned to code functions by following the sequence diagram.</p>
