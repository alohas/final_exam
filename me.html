                <p>I am a 19 year old student from Lithuania. I am studying Multimedia Design and Communication at Kea (Copenhagen School of Design and Technology) in Copenhagen, Denmark. I really enjoy the way we toil in there, because it matches my habits and working style. Here I can express my feelings via media by turning knowledge into a product.</p>
                <h2>My Passions</h2>
                <img class="responsive" src="images/golf-mk4_small.jpg" alt="hot-hatch">
                <p>Since the early years I have been interested in computers. I wanted to know how everything works, how it is done and how to do it myself. When I built my first computer, I started to learn how to use it, how to create beautiful things with it. Same thing happened when I got to fix my first car, so I could drive it. Now I am looking forward to combining all my passions into one big dream.</p>

                <h2>Home city</h2>
                <p>Kaunas is the second-largest city in Lithuania and the historical centre of Lithuanian economic, academic, and cultural life. Kaunas was the biggest city and the centre of a county in Trakai Municipality of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1413. I was born here in 1999 and I am proud that it is my home city. In those 19 years living in Kaunas, I managed to explore almost every street and corner of the city, seen every historical building inside out that I could even make guided tours for foreign visitors and make them see the city with a different point of view. </p>
